# sklearn-classifier

It is a fictitious database in which each line represents a car for sale in an online store. The cars are from several different owners, some of these cars have been sold and some have not. Below we have the top five cars on the table.

The "sold" column represents the cars that were or were not sold: "yes" for sold and "no" for not. We have three features for each of the cars: the first, "mileage_per_year" represents how many miles the car has driven per year; "model_year" represents the year of each model (which is different from the year of manufacture); and, finally, we have the "price", that is, the selling price of each car.

According to these variables, we will try to classify whether a car will be sold or not. Thinking about the company's business, this type of information could help its customers to complete their sales, creating more attractive conditions for potential buyers based on real data and according to the characteristics of each car.
